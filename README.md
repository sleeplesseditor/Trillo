# Trillo

A demo website built using HTML5, CSS3 and SASS (with a specific focus on the use of Flexbox), and using Jonas Schmedtman's [Udemy tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass). The content is currently static, but could be adapted to take dynamic content from a server.

To get this project up and running, follow these steps:

1) cd Trillo
2) npm install
3) npm start
